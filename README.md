# Into The Grid - Test Project

Welcome to this test project! 

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate how you approach the creation of Unity UI interfaces and the scalability of your implementation for future extensions by other team members.

Please before moving forward, clone this repo and create a private GitHub repository with it, you are expected to commit your changes there and give access to @kinerius and @exejutable when you are done.

## Task

For this task, you will design and implement a **Settings Menu**. The configuration and content of the settings menu should be controlled via **Scriptable Objects**.

The menu must include the following customizable features:

- **Sound and SFX Volume Sliders**.
- **Int and Float Configuration Fields for the SFX functionality**.
- **A Toggle Option to disable the SFX button**.

The settings widget should also have an effect on the game. For example, when you adjust the volume sliders, the game's audio should respond to those changes in real time. 

Settings must persist when exiting and entering play mode. 

### Bonus Points

Bonus points for keeping your code clean, organized, scalable, and adhering to the **SOLID** and **KISS** principles.

Bonus points for **Animating** the Settings widget when it opens.

Bonus points for adding Localization to every text and adding a Localization dropdown at the settings menu (english and spanish is enough)

Bonus points for adding a different settings tab with video settings (resolution, fps limit, etc)

### Extra Info

There is no need to upgrade the visual quality of this project.

You can modify all of this project contents including the base scripts and scene.
